PROJECT DESCRIPTION - EXPLORING STORE SALES DATA WITH EXCEL

In this project, I delved into a comprehensive dataset from a store, uncovering valuable insights using a variety of Excel techniques. The dataset provided a wealth of information, including orders, customer ages, order dates, delivery statuses, quantities, currency details, amounts, shipping statistics, and order/product categories.

- KEY INSIGHTS

ORDERS VS MONTH SOLD -  Visualized the trend of orders over different months, clearly understanding seasonal variations and sales peaks.
    Orders by Age & Gender: Utilized bar graphs to showcase the distribution of orders across various age groups and genders, offering insights into the store's target demographics.

ORDER STATUS DISTRIBUTION - Presented order statuses through a pie chart, breaking down the statuses into categories like refunded, canceled, and delivered, providing a snapshot of order fulfillment efficiency.

ORDER CHANNEL ANALYSIS - Created a pie chart to illustrate the distribution of orders across different channels, such as online platforms like Amazon versus in-store purchases from malls.

BREAKDOWN OF ORDERS BY STATES -  Used a bar graph to display top sales categories, highlighting the best-performing product segments. This allowed for strategic decision-making regarding inventory and marketing efforts.

- METHODOLOGIES

    Graphical Representation: Leveraged bar graphs, pie charts, and other visualizations to present the data in an easily understandable format.

    Inference Drawing: By correlating the insights from various graphs, I could draw meaningful conclusions. For instance, understanding which age groups contribute the most to sales, or which sales channels are most effective for different product categories.

    Vendor Comparison: Explored sales from different vendors, such as Amazon and malls, through comparative pie charts, shedding light on the store's partnerships and vendor performance.
